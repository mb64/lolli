This directory contains files related to a still-in-the-works DCG-style
syntax for linear gap-dependency parsers.

The files small.ldcg and big.ldcg contain DCG-style versions of the
small_parser.ll and big_parser.ll files in ../Native_syntax.

ldcg.ll is a preliminary lolli program that read linear-dcg grammars
and outputs equivalent lolli programs.  Note this program is not
complete, and has bugs. It is however worth looking at for 
examples of file i/o and clause manipulation.

big.ll and small.ll are the output of ldcg.ll when run on big.ldcg and
small.ldcg respectively.
