This directory contains a variation of the list rewriting example from
the LICS-91/IC-92 papers. Here the program has been separated into
two modules, one of which implements the core of the rewriter, and the
other of which gives the actual rewrite rules.

The third file, sort.ll uses the basic rewriting idea to implement a 
simple (highly inefficient) sorting routine. It is a good demonstration
of using the module system to provide a level of abstraction and information
hiding.
