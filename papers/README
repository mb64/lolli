This directory contains DVI files for several papers and documents
relevant to Lolli. It duplicates the papers directory in the Lolli
distribution. This way, as papers are added the distribution, those 
who already have Lolli need not retrieve the whole distribution in
order to get the new papers.

elpsml.dvi 	- Elliot & Pfenning, "A Semi-Functional Implementation 
		  of a Higher-Order Logic Programming Language", from
		  "Topics in Advanced Language Implementation" , 
		  MIT Press, Peter Lee editor

		  This paper presents an excellent tutorial on implementing
		  interpreters for Prolog-like languages in a functional
		  setting.


ic92.dvi	- This paper has been removed and replaced with a
		  slightly revised version described below.


ic94.dvi	- Hodas & Miller, "Logic Programming in a Fragment of
		  Intuitionistic Linear Logic", to appear in Information
		  and Computation in late Spring 1994.

		  This paper provides extensive background on the
		  motivations and proof theory of the language.

		  This paper has previously been distributed as ic92.dvi.
		  Some revisions have been incorporated during the lengthy
		  wait for publication.


lppl.dvi	- Hodas, "Lolli - an Extension of \lambda Prolog with
		  Linear Context Management", from the 1992 Workshop on
		  the \lamda Prolog Programming Language. 

		  This short paper can be used as a quick introduction to 
		  Lolli syntax, and the language's relationship to \lambda
		  Prolog.


gap.dvi		- Hodas, "Specifying Filler-Gap Dependency Parsers in a 
		  Linear Logic-Programming Language", to appear in the
		  Proceedings of the 1992 Joint International Conference
		  and Symposium on Logic Programming.

		  This paper expands on the natural language parsing
		  example from ic92.dvi, and develops a general framework
		  for this style of parser.


newio.dvi	- A one page file. This is the specification for the variant
		  of the IO proof system (developed in ic92.dvi) that is
		  actually implemented.
