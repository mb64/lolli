The Release Notes, found in files doc/release-notes/releaseNotes.{txt,ps},
contain instructions for installing the compiler and a more detailed
description of the distribution.


FTP distribution instructions

The primary means of distributing the compiler is anonymous internet
ftp.  For those who do not have internet access directly or
indirectly, distribution by tape is possible as a last resort.  The
following table gives the ftp connection information.

Host:		 	Net Address:	  Directory:
----------------------------------------------------
princeton.edu	 	128.112.128.1	  /pub/ml
research.att.com 	192.20.225.2	  /dist/ml

The directory pub/ml (dist/ml on research.att.com) contains this
README file and the following compressed tar files:

  75.releaseNotes.ps : Postscript version of Release Notes
  75.releaseNotes.txt: raw text version of Release Notes
  75.doc.tar.Z       : the doc directory containing documentation
  75.src.tar.Z       : the src directory containing source code
  75.lib.tar.Z       : the lib directory containing library software
  75.tools.tar.Z     : the tools directory containing useful utilities
  75.mo.m68.tar.Z    : the mo.m68 directory of m68 object files
  75.mo.vax.tar.Z    : the mo.vax directory of vax object files
  75.mo.sparc.tar.Z  : the mo.sparc directory of sparc object files
  75.mo.mipsl.tar.Z  : MIPS Little-endian object files (for DEC machines)
  75.mo.mipsb.tar.Z  : MIPS Big-endian object files (for MIPSCo, SGI)

You need only transfer the 75.mo.*.tar.Z files that you need for your
machines (e.g. 75.mo.m68.tar.Z for Sun 3, NeXT, etc., 75.mo.vax.tar.Z
for Vax).  The Release Notes are also included in the doc directory.

***************************************************************************
NOTE: Ftp should be put into binary mode before transferring the compressed
tar files.
***************************************************************************

Here is a sample dialog:

   ftp
   ftp> open princeton.edu
   Name: anonymous
   Password: <your name@host>
   ftp> binary
   ftp> cd pub/ml
   ftp> get README
   ftp> get 75.src.tar.Z
   ftp> get 75.lib.tar.Z
   ftp> get 75.tools.tar.Z
   ftp> get 75.doc.tar.Z
   ftp> get 75.mo.m68.tar.Z
   ftp> get 75.mo.vax.tar.Z
   ftp> close
   ftp> quit

After the files are transferred they should be uncompressed 
and then extracted using tar into a directory called (e.g.) mldist.
For example:

   mkdir mldist
   mv 75.src.tar.Z mldist
   cd mldist
   zcat 75.src.tar.Z | tar fox -

will install the src directory.
