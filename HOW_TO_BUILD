Building An Executable System
-----------------------------

As mentioned in the README file the Lolli system is written in Standard ML 
of New Jersey*, and the parser and lexer were built using the parser-generator 
(MLYACC) and lexical-analyzer-generator (MLLEX) distributed with that system.
Though source files for the parser and lexer have been included, the
parser and lexer have already been built, so you do not need access to
the MLYACC or MLLEX.

The source files for the system are located in ./src. 

If compilation fails for any reason, please send me mail with a copy
of all of the output you get during the compile.

The firs step of the process is to edit ./src/Makefile to set the SML 
variable to whatever name you use to call Standard ML of New Jersey. Ideally,
you should use the sml-noshare version of the SML compiler (the one that
is used to build SML-NJ itself) as this will generate a significantly
smaller executable file (650KB versus 2.7MB). If you are not sure
whether that version exists at your site, ask your system administrator.

Once you have edited the Makefile, from within the ./sml_source directory, type

make

at the unix prompt. The compilations process generates lots (a few hundred
lines) of messages. About a third of these will be warning messages 
about redundant or non-exhaustive matches -- ignore them.

Run Lolli with the command

	bin/lolli
